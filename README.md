# Getting started

While I'm finding my feet here, will use the older version of GDELT with reduced granularity (daily results, not 15 minute snapshops) and is significantly smaller (1 GB vs 2.5 TB). The table columns are a subset of the full version described [here](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Data_Format_Codebook.pdf).
